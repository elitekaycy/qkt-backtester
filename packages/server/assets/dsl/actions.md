# Actions — BUY, SELL, CLOSE, CANCEL, LOG

The verbs that go after `THEN`. Each action is a complete imperative — "do this exact thing." A rule can have multiple actions separated by `;` or newlines.

## The action verbs

| Verb | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `BUY <stream> ...` | Open or add to a long position |
| `SELL <stream> ...` | Open or add to a short position |
| `CLOSE <stream>` | Flatten the position on this stream |
| `CLOSE_ALL` | Flatten every open position |
| `FLATTEN` | Alias for `CLOSE_ALL` — reads better in session-end / risk-off rules |
| `RESIZE <stream> TO <sizing>` | Trim or add to set the position to a per-bar target size, without close+reopen |
| `CANCEL <stream>` | Cancel any pending orders on this stream |
| `CANCEL_ALL` | Cancel every pending order |
| `OCO_ENTRY { leg1, leg2 }` | Two pending entries linked one-cancels-other; whichever fills, the other auto-cancels |
| `LOG [WARN|ERROR|DEBUG] "<msg>" [field=expr ...]` | Emit a structured log line (default level is INFO) |

`FLATTEN` and `CLOSE_ALL` compile to the same engine path; pick whichever reads more naturally:

```qkt
WHEN NOW.hour_utc = 21 THEN FLATTEN          -- session close
WHEN ACCOUNT.realized_pnl < -1000 THEN FLATTEN   -- daily loss kill switch
```

## `BUY <stream>` and `SELL <stream>`

The entry verbs. Both take the same set of modifiers.

<!-- qkt-doc: grammar -->
```qkt
BUY <stream>
    [ SIZING <size_spec> ]
    [ <order_type_modifier> ]
    [ BRACKET { ... } ]
    [ STACK ... ]
    [ TIF <gtc|ioc|fok|day> ]
    [ ON_STOP { ... } ]
    [ ON_TP { ... } ]
    [ ON_CLOSE { ... } ]
```

Trailing-stop order types ship as `ORDER_TYPE = TRAILING BY <distance>` and `ORDER_TYPE = TRAILING PCT <percent>` (see [Trailing stop](../../how-to/add-stop-loss.md#trailing-stop) in the stop-loss recipe). `1 PCT` means 1%; the percentage must be greater than 0 and less than 100.

### Minimal BUY (uses DEFAULTS)

```qkt
WHEN ema(btc.close, 9) CROSSES ABOVE ema(btc.close, 21)
THEN BUY btc SIZING 0.1
```

This is valid only if `DEFAULTS { sizing = ... }` is set (otherwise the parser complains). Sizing is the only field without a sensible compile-time default.

### Full BUY

```qkt
BUY btc
    SIZING 1.0 PCT RISK
    BRACKET {
      STOP_LOSS AT btc.close - atr(btc, 14) * 2,
      TAKE_PROFIT AT btc.close + atr(btc, 14) * 6
    }
    TIF GTC
```

`SELL` is identical in shape, just opens a short instead of a long.

### Order type modifiers

By default `BUY`/`SELL` submit market orders. To submit a limit order:

```qkt
BUY btc SIZING 0.1 ORDER_TYPE = LIMIT AT 67000      -- limit order at $67,000
```

To submit a stop entry (buy on breakout above a level):

```qkt
BUY btc SIZING 0.1 ORDER_TYPE = STOP AT 67500       -- triggers when price hits $67,500
```

!!! info "Stop-limit and if-touched coming in Phase 25"
    `STOP_LIMIT AT … LIMIT_PRICE …` and `IF_TOUCHED AT …` are **planned but not yet shipped**. See [Planned features](../../planned.md). Today, only `MARKET`, `LIMIT AT`, and `STOP AT` are supported as entry order types.

The order type modifier replaces the default `MARKET` and goes right after the stream/sizing.

## `CLOSE <stream>` and `CLOSE_ALL`

`CLOSE <stream>` flattens the position on that stream at market. No sizing needed — it closes the
full current position. When the position has venue ticket metadata, qkt targets that ticket
explicitly. This closes the position on MT5 hedging accounts instead of opening an offsetting
counter-position; netting accounts reach the same flat result.

```qkt
WHEN ema(btc.close, 9) CROSSES BELOW ema(btc.close, 21)
 AND POSITION.btc > 0
THEN CLOSE btc
```

`CLOSE_ALL` does the same for every open position across all symbols. Use sparingly — usually you want to be precise.

## `RESIZE <stream> TO <sizing>`

Set an open position to a target size each bar, trimming or adding to reach it without
close+reopen. This is the volatility-targeting / rebalancing primitive: a position whose
exposure should scale inversely to realized volatility, or to a target portfolio weight.

```qkt
-- Scale gold exposure inversely to its volatility, re-sized every bar.
WHEN POSITION.gold != 0
THEN RESIZE gold TO 0.01 / atr(gold.candle, 14)
```

- `<sizing>` reuses the SIZING grammar, so the target can be a quantity expression, `PCT OF
  EQUITY` (rebalance to a target weight), `NOTIONAL`, etc. It evaluates to a **target
  magnitude** for the symbol's primary position. (`RISK`-based sizing needs a stop distance and
  is not available here.)
- It resizes the existing primary to that magnitude, **same side**. `TO 0` flattens it. With no
  open position it is a no-op — open with `BUY`/`SELL` first.
- A grow is a same-side market add (averaged into the position); a shrink is a partial close at
  market (entry price preserved, P&L realized on the closed portion). Both fill at the bar price,
  so backtest equals live.
- `MIN_STEP <expr>` sets an anti-churn deadband — the smallest `|target − current|` worth acting
  on (default 5% of the target). Skips the micro-orders a continuous target would otherwise emit.

```qkt
RESIZE aud TO 0.02 / atr(aud.candle, 20) MIN_STEP 0.002
```

For risk on a resized position, use a `CLOSE` rule — it always flattens the **current** position
size, so it tracks the resize for free:

```qkt
WHEN gold.close < gold.close[1] - 3 * atr(gold.candle, 14) THEN CLOSE gold
```

Do **not** combine `RESIZE` with a `BRACKET` on the same entry: a bracketed position is held as a
separate, ticketed leg that the net-position resize cannot see. Resize works on the net position
that plain `BUY`/`SELL` opens; pair it with the `CLOSE`-rule stop above.

```qkt
WHEN ACCOUNT.equity < 5000
THEN CLOSE_ALL ;
     LOG WARN "equity below safety threshold — flattening"
```

## `CANCEL <stream>` and `CANCEL_ALL`

Cancels working orders without touching open positions.

```qkt
CANCEL btc           -- cancel any pending orders on btc, leaves the position alone
CANCEL_ALL           -- cancel every pending order
```

Use case: a STACK strategy with unfilled layers — you want to cancel the rest when conditions change.

```qkt
WHEN regime_changed
THEN CANCEL btc ;    -- abandon unfilled stack layers
     CLOSE btc       -- close the already-filled portion
```

## `OCO_ENTRY { leg1, leg2 }` {#oco_entry}

Submits two pending entry orders linked one-cancels-other. When either leg fills, the broker auto-cancels the other. Use for breakout straddles where you don't know which direction will resolve first.

```qkt
OCO_ENTRY {
    BUY  gold SIZING 0.20 ORDER_TYPE = STOP AT gold.close + 50
         BRACKET { STOP LOSS BY 180, TAKE PROFIT BY 150 }
         TIF GTD UNTIL NOW + 10m,
    SELL gold SIZING 0.20 ORDER_TYPE = STOP AT gold.close - 50
         BRACKET { STOP LOSS BY 180, TAKE PROFIT BY 150 }
         TIF GTD UNTIL NOW + 10m
}
```

Both legs are submitted to the broker as pending orders (typically `STOP AT` or `LIMIT AT`). Whichever triggers first becomes the live position; the OrderManager cancels the sibling on receipt of the fill event. Each leg carries its own `BRACKET` — when a leg fills, its stop-loss and take-profit attach to that position automatically.

### Children

- **Exactly two legs.** `OCO_ENTRY { ... }` with 0, 1, or 3+ legs is a parse error.
- **Each leg must be `BUY` or `SELL`.** Including `LOG`, `CLOSE`, or `CANCEL` inside an `OCO_ENTRY` block is a parse error.
- **Same stream or different streams.** The DSL doesn't restrict; the broker decides. Same-symbol opposite-side is the hedge-straddle case; different-symbol same-side is a pairs-trading entry.

### Time-in-force

The two legs typically share a `TIF GTD UNTIL NOW + <duration>` clause so both expire together if neither triggers. See [NOW](now.md) for relative deadlines.

### Common gotchas

- **Same-bar dual breach.** If a single candle's high and low cross both stop prices, the tiebreak is broker-dependent. In backtest, the leg with the closer trigger to the candle's open fills first.
- **Broker capability.** Bybit Spot is netting-only and does not support pending-pair OCO. Bybit Linear with hedge-mode and MT5 brokers (Phase 17 + 26b) do. As of Phase 26b, MT5 translates the pending family natively (BUY_STOP, SELL_STOP, BUY_LIMIT, SELL_LIMIT, BUY_STOP_LIMIT, SELL_STOP_LIMIT, server-side trailing). Async fill-event lifecycle (cancel-on-fill across MT5 tickets) lands in Phase 26c — until then, pending placements succeed live but qkt-side fill events for pending shapes arrive lazily via the position poller.
- **Pending orders aren't positions.** `POSITION.<stream> = 0` returns true while OCO legs are pending; gate entries with `POSITION.<stream> = 0 AND not has_pending_oco(...)` if you need that distinction.

### What this composes with

- [NOW](now.md) — session-hour gating + `NOW + duration` for GTD expiry
- [BRACKET](bracket.md) — per-leg SL/TP attached to the surviving fill

## Exit hooks: `ON_STOP`, `ON_TP`, and `ON_CLOSE`

A `BUY` or `SELL` can attach one-shot actions to the way its position exits:

```qkt
BUY gold SIZING 0.1
  BRACKET { STOP LOSS BY 50, TAKE PROFIT BY 100 }
  ON_STOP {
    SELL gold SIZING EXIT.qty
      BRACKET { STOP LOSS BY 50, TAKE PROFIT BY 100 }
  }
  ON_TP {
    BUY gold SIZING EXIT.qty
      ORDER_TYPE = LIMIT WITH 30
      TIF GTD UNTIL NOW + 2h
  }
  ON_CLOSE {
    BUY gold SIZING 0.05
  }
```

- `ON_STOP` runs when the stop-loss closes the hooked position.
- `ON_TP` runs when the take-profit closes it.
- `ON_CLOSE` runs for another flatten, including an explicit `CLOSE`, a time/risk exit,
  or a venue-side manual close.

The child actions travel through the ordinary strategy signal, book-scaling, risk, and
broker path. A hook fires once after its hooked position is fully closed; partial exit
fills accumulate until that point. Hooks and their partial-fill progress survive a
restart.

### Exit context

Only hook blocks can read the `EXIT` namespace:

| Accessor | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `EXIT.price` | Terminal closing fill price |
| `EXIT.side` | Closing fill side: `BUY` or `SELL` |
| `EXIT.qty` | Total quantity closed by this exit |
| `EXIT.pnl` | Net realized strategy PnL accumulated across the exit fills |
| `EXIT.reason` | `STOP`, `TP`, or `CLOSE` |

Using `EXIT.*` anywhere else is a compile error. String fields such as `EXIT.side` and
`EXIT.reason` are useful in structured `LOG` fields; numeric fields can size and price
orders.

Inside a hook, a pending entry can be relative to the exit price:

<!-- qkt-doc: grammar -->
```qkt
ORDER_TYPE = LIMIT WITH 30
ORDER_TYPE = STOP AGAINST 20
```

`WITH` follows the closing side and `AGAINST` moves opposite it. For example, a
take-profit that closes a long with `SELL` resolves `LIMIT WITH 30` below the exit
price, suitable for a pullback re-entry.

### v1 constraints

- Hook blocks contain `BUY`, `SELL`, or `LOG` actions, separated by `;`.
- A child may carry a `BRACKET` and `TIF GTD`.
- A child cannot declare `ON_FILL`, another exit hook, `OCO`, `STACK`, or `STACK_AT`.
- A hook-bearing parent may be plain, `BRACKET`, or `STACK`; it cannot also use
  `ON_FILL`, `OCO`, or `STACK_AT`.

The one-level nesting limit prevents an accidental infinite stop-and-reverse loop.

## `LOG`

Emits a structured log line. Three levels (`INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `DEBUG`) and optional structured fields.

<!-- qkt-doc: grammar -->
```qkt
LOG [LEVEL] "<msg>" [<key>=<expr> ...]
```

### Simple message

```qkt
THEN LOG "entered long position"
```

Output (with the default logback config):

```text
2026-05-11T10:23:45.123 [main] INFO  com.qkt.app.LiveSession - [my-strategy] entered long position
```

### With placeholders

`{name}` placeholders in the message string get filled from the structured fields:

```qkt
THEN LOG "long entry at {price} with stop at {stopPrice}"
     price=btc.close
     stopPrice=btc.close - atr(btc, 14) * 2
```

The `{price}` and `{stopPrice}` in the string are replaced with the evaluated values. The fields **also** appear in the JSON output (if you're using structured logging) under `log.price` and `log.stopPrice`.

### Levels

`INFO` is the implicit default — `LOG "..."` produces an INFO line. For other levels use the keyword:

```qkt
LOG       "..."        -- INFO (default)
LOG WARN  "..."        -- something unusual but not fatal
LOG ERROR "..."        -- something failed
LOG DEBUG "..."        -- low-level detail; usually filtered out in production
```

There is no explicit `LOG INFO` keyword form — INFO is reached by omitting the level.

## Combining actions

Multiple actions per rule, separated by `;`:

```qkt
WHEN regime_changed
THEN
    CANCEL btc ;                                  -- cancel any pending btc orders
    CLOSE btc ;                                   -- flatten btc position
    LOG "regime change" old=old_regime new=new_regime
```

Actions fire in order. The next action sees the state after the previous one (so `LOG` after `CLOSE` sees the closed position).

## Optional clauses, in order

When you stack modifiers on a `BUY`/`SELL`, the order matters but the parser is forgiving:

1. `<stream>` (required)
2. `SIZING <spec>` (or inherited from `DEFAULTS`)
3. Order-type modifier (`ORDER_TYPE = LIMIT AT <price>`, `ORDER_TYPE = STOP AT <price>`) — defaults to market
4. `BRACKET { STOP_LOSS ..., TAKE_PROFIT ... }` — both legs are required
5. `STACK <n> SPACING <points> ABOVE|BELOW [WITHIN <duration>]` — pyramiding
6. `STACK_AT MFE >= <threshold> WITHIN <duration> SIZING <qty> BRACKET { ... }` or `STACK_AT MAE >= <threshold> RECOVER <distance> WITHIN <duration> ...` — conditional bracketed stacks (multiple per action allowed; see [STACK_AT](stack-at.md))
7. `TIMES <expression>` — repeat the whole entry N times (see [TIMES](times.md))
8. `TIF <mode>` — time-in-force
9. `ON_STOP`, `ON_TP`, and `ON_CLOSE` — one-shot exit hooks
10. `LOG ...` — usually a separate action after `;` but can be inline-chained

The most common patterns:

```qkt
-- Simple market buy with bracket
BUY btc SIZING 0.1 BRACKET { STOP_LOSS BY 1 PCT, TAKE_PROFIT BY 2 PCT }

-- Limit entry with bracket
BUY btc SIZING 0.1 ORDER_TYPE = LIMIT AT 67000 BRACKET { STOP_LOSS BY 300, TAKE_PROFIT BY 600 }


-- Stacked with shared bracket
BUY btc SIZING 0.1 STACK 3 SPACING 200 ABOVE WITHIN 4h
    BRACKET { STOP_LOSS BY 300, TAKE_PROFIT BY 1000 }

-- Thirty independent bracketed entries at once
BUY btc SIZING 0.01 BRACKET { STOP_LOSS BY 300, TAKE_PROFIT BY 600 } TIMES 30
```

## Common gotchas

- **`BUY btc` without `SIZING` and without `DEFAULTS.sizing` is a parse error.** Sizing is required at exactly one of: action, DEFAULTS.
- **`CLOSE` doesn't take a size.** It closes the whole position. To exit partially, use a `BRACKET` with scale-out targets or a `SELL` that fires when long.
- **Edge-trigger gotcha for entries.** Without `AND POSITION.<stream> = 0`, a `BUY` rule fires once on signal — then if the signal stays true, it doesn't re-fire (edge-trigger). If you want re-entry capability, ensure the position guard is in place.
- **`LOG` is not an exit.** Logging doesn't change strategy state. Use `CLOSE` or `CANCEL` for actions; `LOG` for the audit trail.
- **`TRAILING` order type requires the explicit `ORDER_TYPE =` keyword.** Use `BUY btc ORDER_TYPE = TRAILING BY 50` — bare `BUY btc TRAILING BY 50` parses the BUY without an order type and chokes on `TRAILING` as the next statement.

## What this composes with

- [SIZING](sizing.md) — every way to specify position size
- [BRACKET](bracket.md) — stop-loss and take-profit groups
- [STACK](stack.md) — pyramiding multiple entries from one signal
- [STACK_AT](stack-at.md) — conditional bracketed stacks fired by MFE thresholds
- [Streams](streams.md) — what `<stream>` refers to
- [LOG/Logging](../../operations/logging.md) — log routing, MDC keys, file outputs

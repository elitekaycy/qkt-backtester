# BRACKET

A `BRACKET` attaches a stop-loss and a take-profit to an entry as one atomic group. The broker submits them together; when either side fills, the other auto-cancels (one-cancels-other semantics).

## Shape

<!-- qkt-doc: grammar -->
```qkt
BUY <stream> SIZING <size>
    BRACKET {
      STOP_LOSS <distance_or_price>,
      TAKE_PROFIT <distance_or_price>
    }
```

Or, less verbose, the bare form (without the `BRACKET { ... }` wrapper) when you only need a stop:

<!-- qkt-doc: grammar -->
```qkt
BUY <stream> SIZING <size>
    STOP_LOSS <distance_or_price>
```

## Distance specifications

Both `STOP_LOSS` and `TAKE_PROFIT` accept these forms:

### `BY <points>` — fixed distance in quote currency

```qkt
BRACKET {
  STOP_LOSS BY 100,
  TAKE_PROFIT BY 300
}
```

For BTC at $67,000 long, stop at $66,900, target at $67,300. The units match the symbol's quote (USD for crypto, pips for FX *but converted to price points*).

### `BY <pct> PCT` — percent of entry price

```qkt
BRACKET {
  STOP_LOSS BY 1.0 PCT,
  TAKE_PROFIT BY 3.0 PCT
}
```

For BTC at $67,000 long, stop at $66,330, target at $69,010.
The value is a percentage, not a fraction: `1 PCT` means 1%. Stop-loss percentages
must be at least 0.01 and less than 50; take-profit percentages must also be at least
0.01. Smaller values are rejected with a percent-units hint because they commonly
indicate a fraction-scale input such as `0.004` where `0.4` was intended.

> **Compatibility:** runtimes before commit `788a90f1` interpreted this operand as a
> fraction (`0.004` meant 0.4%). Current runtimes use percentage points, so the
> economically equivalent value is `0.4`. Migrate old strategy sources and parameter
> grids before replaying them on a current runtime.

### `AT <price_expression>` — absolute price

```qkt
BRACKET {
  STOP_LOSS AT btc.close - atr(btc, 14) * 2,
  TAKE_PROFIT AT btc.close + atr(btc, 14) * 6
}
```

Computed at action-execute time. `btc.close` is the entry price (the close of the bar that fired the rule). Arithmetic, indicator calls, and `LET`-bound values all work.

That bar close is only the placement-time estimate. For fill-anchored fixed brackets,
live execution modifies venue protection to the actual fill geometry after acceptance.
If the venue rejects that modification, qkt reports a protection failure and arms an
engine-held stop at the intended fill-anchored level. Engine-held protection requires
healthy tick delivery.

### Mixing

You can mix forms in one bracket:

```qkt
BRACKET {
  STOP_LOSS BY 2.0 PCT,                                  -- percent stop
  TAKE_PROFIT AT btc.close + atr(btc, 14) * 6            -- ATR target
}
```

## Scale-out (multi-leg take-profit) — not implemented

A bracket carries exactly one take-profit. A fractional multi-leg take-profit
(`TAKE_PROFIT { 0.33 AT ..., 0.33 AT ... }`) does not parse and has no AST; earlier
revisions of this page documented one that was never built.

To bank a position in pieces today, choose one of:

- **Repeat the entry instead of splitting the exit.** `BUY btc SIZING 0.01 TIMES 3` with a
  different `TAKE_PROFIT` per action gives three independently-exiting positions and is the
  closest equivalent. See [TIMES](times.md).
- **`RESIZE`** trims an open position toward a target size, but it is not usable alongside a
  `BRACKET` on the same position — see the gotchas below.

## Complete protection

`STOP_LOSS` and `TAKE_PROFIT` are currently a complete bracket pair. A bare
stop or take-profit, including one inherited from `DEFAULTS`, is rejected at
compile time. Use a `BRACKET` with both legs and keep any additional
rule-driven `CLOSE` condition alongside it.

## Trailing stop

Trailing stops aren't a `BRACKET` leg — they're an order type on the entry itself:

```qkt
BUY btc SIZING 0.1 ORDER_TYPE = TRAILING BY atr(btc, 14) * 2
SELL btc SIZING 0.1 ORDER_TYPE = TRAILING PCT 5
```

See [the stop-loss recipe](../../how-to/add-stop-loss.md#trailing-stop) for semantics and engine-vs-broker routing.

## Armed trailing stop

`STOP LOSS TRAILING <distance> AFTER MFE >= <threshold>` adds a one-way armed trailing stop as a bracket leg. The stop sits at a fixed distance from the entry until the trade's maximum favorable excursion (MFE) crosses `<threshold>`, then converts to a trailing stop at the same distance from the running favorable extreme.

```qkt
BUY btc SIZING 0.1 BRACKET {
  STOP LOSS TRAILING 5 AFTER MFE >= 10,
  TAKE PROFIT BY 50
}
```

Semantics:

- **Pre-arm:** stop sits at `entry − distance` (BUY) or `entry + distance` (SELL).
- **Arming:** when MFE crosses `<threshold>`, the stop arms and starts tracking the favorable extreme.
- **Post-arm:** stop sits at `hwm − distance` (BUY) or `hwm + distance` (SELL), where `hwm` is the running favorable extreme since fill.
- Arming is one-way: once armed, the stop never disarms.
- The same `<distance>` value applies pre and post — only the reference point shifts (entry → hwm).

`<distance>` must be positive and `<threshold>` non-negative; `<threshold>` of zero means "trail from inception." Either may be an expression such as `atr(btc.candle, 14) * 2`: it is evaluated once when the order is built, from the signal bar, and the trail keeps that fixed distance from then on. If an operand is still undefined during warm-up, or evaluates to a value outside those bounds, the order is skipped. Inside a `STACK` bracket both must be numeric literals. `TAKE PROFIT TRAILING` is rejected at parse time — armed trailing is stop-only.

Risk-based sizing (`SIZING RISK $ N`) sees `<distance>` as the worst-case stop distance regardless of arming state.

The arming logic is always engine-managed: brokers that support native brackets see only the entry and TP; the engine owns the stop and re-evaluates its level on every tick.

See [Phase 36 — Armed trailing stop](../../phases/phase-36-armed-trailing-stop.md) for the worked examples and known limitations.

## Stepped stop ratchet

A stepped stop locks discrete, direction-relative profit milestones:

```qkt
BUY btc SIZING 0.1 BRACKET {
  STOP LOSS BY 50
    STEP TO BREAKEVEN AFTER MFE >= 30
    STEP TO ENTRY + 40 AFTER MFE >= 70,
  TAKE PROFIT BY 120
}
```

The initial stop is 50 points from the fill. At 30 points of MFE it moves to
entry; at 70 points it moves to 40 points of locked profit. `BREAKEVEN + <d>`
and `ENTRY + <d>` are equivalent direction-relative targets, so the same source
works for long and short entries.

Thresholds must be strictly increasing and target distances non-negative. The
initial distance, thresholds and targets may be expressions (for example
`STOP LOSS BY atr(btc.candle, 14) * 2 STEP TO BREAKEVEN AFTER MFE >= atr(btc.candle, 14)`):
they are evaluated once when the order is built and fixed for the life of the
trade, and an undefined or invalid evaluation skips the order. Inside a `STACK`
bracket they must be numeric literals. Each step is consumed once. A target that
would widen the current stop is skipped with an operator warning.

## Time-tightening stop

A time-tightening stop reduces its risk distance on the injected engine clock:

```qkt
BUY btc SIZING 0.1 BRACKET {
  STOP LOSS BY 60 TIGHTEN BY 10 EVERY 15m FLOOR 20,
  TAKE PROFIT BY 120
}
```

It starts 60 points from the fill, tightens by 10 points per completed 15-minute
interval, and stops tightening at a 20-point distance. The initial distance,
tightening delta, and floor must be positive, and the floor cannot exceed the
initial distance. Like the stepped stop, they may be expressions evaluated once
when the order is built (numeric literals inside a `STACK` bracket).

Both ratchet forms are engine-managed in paper/backtest and live execution. The
engine evaluates only live stops for the tick's symbol, persists ratchet progress
for restart, and never widens a stop. On venues with position modification, each
tightening transition is also mirrored to the venue position so the tighter stop
continues protecting it if qkt goes offline.

## How the bracket reaches the broker

The DSL submits one `BRACKET` request to the order manager. From there:

1. **If the broker supports `BRACKET` natively** (MT5 brokers, PaperBroker): the order manager submits the entry + stop + target as one atomic group. The venue handles OCO semantics.

2. **If the broker doesn't** (Bybit Spot via REST): the order manager submits the entry alone. On fill, it submits the stop and target as separate orders linked by OCO state. When one fills, the other auto-cancels via the engine.

The DSL is the same either way. See [Broker integration](../../concepts/broker-integration.md) for the capability matrix.

## Defaults via `DEFAULTS`

If most of your strategies use the same bracket pattern, hoist it:

```qkt
DEFAULTS {
  SIZING = 0.1
  STOP_LOSS = BY atr(SYMBOL, 14) * 2          -- 2-ATR stop
  TAKE_PROFIT = BY atr(SYMBOL, 14) * 6        -- 6-ATR target (3R)
}

RULES
    WHEN signal_condition
    THEN BUY btc     -- inherits sizing + stop + target
```

`SYMBOL` substitutes for the rule's stream at compile time. See [LET and DEFAULTS](let-defaults.md).

## Common gotchas

- **Wrong side stop direction.** For a `BUY`, the stop must be **below** the entry price. The parser does check this for absolute prices but can't always check expressions (`btc.close + 100` for a long stop is a logic error). Test on backtest before live.
- **Bracket stop too close** — MT5 brokers enforce `tradeStopsLevel` minimum distance. Orders too tight reject at the venue. Use `atr * <multiplier>` to scale; if the multiplier produces too-tight stops in low-vol regimes, the order rejects.
- **There is no `TRAILING_STOP` clause.** Use a trailing entry (`ORDER_TYPE = TRAILING BY <distance>`) or an armed trailing stop leg (`STOP LOSS TRAILING <distance> AFTER MFE >= <threshold>`), both above.
- **Limit-entry bracket execution.** When the entry is a limit order (`BUY btc SIZING 0.1 ORDER_TYPE = LIMIT AT 67000 BRACKET ...`), the bracket only activates after the limit fills. If the limit never fills, the bracket never sends.

## What this composes with

- [Actions](actions.md) — `BRACKET` is a modifier on `BUY`/`SELL`
- [SIZING](sizing.md) — risk-based sizing (`PCT RISK`) requires a stop in the bracket (or bare)
- [Indicators](indicators.md) — ATR is the canonical stop input
- [Expressions](expressions.md) — arithmetic in stop/target prices
- [Mean-reversion example](../../examples/mean-reversion.md) — heavy use of scale-out brackets

# Expressions

The values you can compute inside conditions, action parameters, and `LET` bindings. Everything in qkt — numbers, booleans, indicator values, account state — composes the same way.

## Literals

```qkt
100               -- integer
1.5               -- decimal
0.001             -- decimal
1e-3              -- scientific notation
"hello"           -- string (mostly for LOG)
'BUY'             -- single-quoted string also works
TRUE              -- boolean
FALSE
```

There is no `NULL` literal. A missing value comes from data (a lookback past the start of history, an indicator still warming up); test for it with [`IS NULL`](#is-null-is-not-null).

Numbers are parsed as exact decimals internally (BigDecimal). No floating-point drift over thousands of trades.
Strings support exact, case-sensitive `=` / `==` and `!=` / `<>` comparisons. Ordered comparisons
(`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) remain numeric-only.

## Arithmetic

<!-- qkt-doc: grammar -->
```qkt
a + b             -- addition
a - b             -- subtraction
a * b             -- multiplication
a / b             -- division
-a                -- unary negation
```

Standard precedence: `* /` before `+ -`. There is no `%` operator; use `mod(<a>, <b>)` (see [Indicators](indicators.md#math-helpers)). Use parentheses for clarity:

```qkt
WHEN (btc.high - btc.low) / btc.close > 0.02     -- 2% range
THEN LOG "volatile bar"
```

## Comparison and boolean

Covered in [Conditions](conditions.md):

- `=` / `==`, `!=` / `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- `BETWEEN ... AND ...`
- `IN [...]`
- `CROSSES ABOVE`, `CROSSES BELOW`
- `<expr> IS NULL`, `<expr> IS NOT NULL`

### `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL`

```qkt
EMA(gold.close, 50) IS NULL                 -- true while the indicator hasn't received 50 closes yet
gold.bid IS NOT NULL AND gold.bid < ASK     -- gate that only fires when a quote is available
```

Tests whether the inner expression evaluates to "missing" — the internal `Value.Undefined` sentinel produced by indicators that haven't warmed, snapshots that haven't been captured, missing optional fields (`btc.bid` on a no-quote feed), and any arithmetic that propagated an `Undefined`.

`IS NULL` always returns a boolean — it never propagates `Undefined` itself, so it composes safely with `AND` / `OR`. Binds tighter than `AND`, so `fast IS NOT NULL AND slow IS NOT NULL AND CROSSES(fast, slow) ABOVE` parses without parentheses.

## Stream field access

```qkt
btc.open
btc.high
btc.low
btc.close
btc.volume
btc.bid           -- optional (quote feeds only)
btc.ask
btc.spread        -- ask - bid, computed when both present
```

`btc.timestamp` is the bar's start time in epoch milliseconds, and `btc.timestamp[n]` is the start of the bar `n` bars ago. It is not a price series: `ema(btc.timestamp, 9)` is an error. For the strategy's clock use [`NOW`](now.md), with fields such as `NOW.hour_utc` and `NOW.weekday`. There is no `btc.mid` either; compute `(btc.bid + btc.ask) / 2`.

Lookback:

```qkt
btc.close         -- current closed candle's close
btc.close[0]      -- same as btc.close
btc.close[1]      -- previous candle
btc.close[20]     -- 20 bars ago
```

Out-of-range returns `null` (which makes any containing comparison `false`).

## Indicator calls

See [Indicators](indicators.md) for the full catalog.

```qkt
ema(btc.close, 9)            -- numeric series (closed-candle field)
rsi(btc.close, 14)
atr(btc.candle, 14)          -- candle series (needs OHLC)
highest(btc.close, 20)
vwap(btc.tick, 100)          -- tick series (per-tick price + volume, not candle close)
```

Treat them as numbers — they slot into any arithmetic context.

### Series argument shape per indicator kind

- **Numeric** (`ema`, `sma`, `rsi`, …): take a stream field like `btc.close`. Strategy-author picks which OHLCV field to feed.
- **Candle** (`atr`): take `<stream>.candle` (the whole OHLCV record). The indicator reads multiple fields internally.
- **Tick** (`vwap`): take `<stream>.tick` (raw ticks, not candle-aggregated). Updates on every tick, not only on candle close. Requires `Tick.volume` to be present — live MT5/Bybit feeds carry it; backtest feeds need to provide it explicitly.

## Account references

```qkt
ACCOUNT.equity         -- cash + open P&L
ACCOUNT.balance        -- cash only
ACCOUNT.realized_pnl   -- realized P&L since strategy start
ACCOUNT.unrealized_pnl -- open-position P&L right now
ACCOUNT.total_pnl      -- realized + unrealized
```

```qkt
LET riskUsd = ACCOUNT.equity * 0.01            -- 1% of equity at risk
LET riskQty = riskUsd / (atr(btc, 14) * 2)     -- size that loses riskUsd on a 2-ATR stop
```

### Trade-history accessors (Phase 25-followup #132)

```qkt
ACCOUNT.last_trade_at    -- epoch ms of the most recent fill on this strategy; null before any trade
ACCOUNT.last_trade_pnl   -- realized P&L of the most recent closed trade; null before any close
ACCOUNT.win_streak       -- consecutive closed wins (0 if last close was a loss / no trades yet)
ACCOUNT.loss_streak      -- consecutive closed losses
ACCOUNT.dd_pct           -- current drawdown from this strategy's equity peak, as a percent (5.0 = 5%)
ACCOUNT.realized_today   -- this strategy's closed-trade P&L since UTC midnight
ACCOUNT.realized_month   -- this strategy's closed-trade P&L since the 1st of the UTC month
```

`realized_today` and `realized_month` reset at their UTC boundary and survive a daemon restart within the same day or month. They are in account currency; a monthly loss gate in risk units multiplies your per-trade risk:

```qkt
STRATEGY monthly_gate VERSION 1
SYMBOLS
    eur = EXNESS:EURUSD EVERY 30m
PARAM riskUsd = 50
RULES
    -- Stop opening new trades once this month's closed losses reach 3R; exits still run.
    WHEN eur.close > eur.open AND POSITION.eur = 0 AND ACCOUNT.realized_month > -3 * riskUsd
    THEN BUY eur SIZING 0.1
```

`STREAK` exposes the same outcome stream through the issue-facing ladder namespace:

```qkt
STREAK.wins       -- consecutive closed wins
STREAK.losses     -- consecutive closed losses
STREAK.banked     -- realized P&L banked during the current win streak

TRADES.today            -- entry fills recorded for this strategy since UTC midnight
COOLDOWN.remaining_s    -- seconds left in the configured after-loss cooldown, or 0
```

`last_trade_at` and `last_trade_pnl` return `Value.Undefined` until the strategy has closed at least one trade — compose with `IS NULL` for safe gating:

```qkt
-- Cooldown between entries: don't re-enter for an hour after a trade.
WHEN signal AND POSITION.btc = 0
 AND (ACCOUNT.last_trade_at IS NULL OR NOW.epoch_ms - ACCOUNT.last_trade_at > 3600000)
THEN BUY btc SIZING 0.5 PCT RISK BRACKET { STOP_LOSS BY 300, TAKE_PROFIT BY 600 }

-- Self-halt on drawdown: stop trading at 5% DD until equity recovers.
WHEN signal AND ACCOUNT.dd_pct < 5
THEN BUY btc SIZING 0.5 PCT RISK BRACKET { STOP_LOSS BY 300, TAKE_PROFIT BY 600 }

-- Loss-streak-aware sizing: scale down after consecutive losses.
WHEN signal AND STREAK.losses < 2
THEN BUY btc SIZING 1.0 PCT RISK BRACKET { STOP_LOSS BY 300, TAKE_PROFIT BY 600 }
WHEN signal AND STREAK.losses >= 2
THEN BUY btc SIZING 0.5 PCT RISK BRACKET { STOP_LOSS BY 300, TAKE_PROFIT BY 600 }
```

Win and loss streaks are exclusive — `STREAK.losses >= 1` implies `STREAK.wins = 0` and vice versa. Both return `0` until the strategy has closed at least one trade. The bounded trade-history buffer is persisted with engine state when persistence is enabled; otherwise a fresh process starts with empty streak state.

A "win" is `realized_pnl > 0` for the closing fill; "loss" is `< 0`. Position-opening fills (zero realized) are skipped entirely — they don't count toward either streak.

`STREAK.banked` sums only the consecutive winning closes at the end of history. A loss resets it to `0`, so it can be used to press with banked profit without increasing base risk after a losing close:

```qkt
THEN BUY btc SIZING RISK $ (100 + 0.30 * STREAK.banked) BRACKET { STOP_LOSS BY 300, TAKE_PROFIT BY 600 }
```

`TRADES.today` and `COOLDOWN.remaining_s` read the same PACER ledger used by configured per-strategy throttles. `TRADES.today` counts entry fills, not closed round trips.

## Position references

<!-- qkt-doc: grammar -->
```qkt
POSITION.<stream>                           -- net quantity (signed) — same as POSITION.<stream>.quantity
POSITION.<stream>.quantity                  -- explicit form
POSITION.<stream>.entry_price               -- average entry price
POSITION.<stream>.pnl                       -- strategy realized + this-symbol unrealized
POSITION.<stream>.realized_pnl              -- strategy-level realized P&L (see note)
POSITION.<stream>.unrealized_pnl            -- open P&L on this position
POSITION.<stream>.holding_duration          -- seconds since the position was opened
POSITION.<stream>.mfe                       -- max favorable excursion of the PRIMARY leg (price units)
POSITION.<stream>.mae                       -- max adverse excursion of the PRIMARY leg (price units)
OPEN_ORDERS.<stream>                        -- active risk-increasing entry-order count
```

```qkt
WHEN POSITION.btc > 0
 AND POSITION.btc.unrealized_pnl > POSITION.btc.entry_price * 0.05    -- 5% in profit
THEN CLOSE btc
```

`POSITION.<stream>.mfe` reads the high-water mark of `current_price - entry_price` (for BUY) or `entry_price - current_price` (for SELL) on the PRIMARY leg since it opened. Returns `0` if no primary exists. Same value the stack engine uses for `STACK_AT MFE >= ...` threshold checks; see [STACK_AT](stack-at.md).

`POSITION.<stream>.mae` reads the high-water mark of `entry_price - current_price` (for BUY) or `current_price - entry_price` (for SELL) on the PRIMARY leg since it opened. Returns `0` if no primary exists. Same value the stack engine uses for `STACK_AT MAE >= ... RECOVER ...` arming checks.

`POSITION.<stream>` returns a signed quantity. `POSITION.btc > 0` means long; `POSITION.btc < 0` means short; `POSITION.btc = 0` means flat. Most entry rules guard with `POSITION.btc = 0`.

`OPEN_ORDERS.<stream>` is scoped to the current strategy and resolved stream symbol. It counts active risk-increasing entries in pending, submitted, working, or partially-filled states. It excludes dormant composite children and protective or otherwise risk-reducing exits. Terminal fills, cancellations, rejections, and GTD expiry remove the entry from the count through the same order lifecycle used in replay and live execution.

```qkt
WHEN setup
 AND POSITION.gold = 0
 AND OPEN_ORDERS.gold = 0
THEN SELL gold ORDER_TYPE = LIMIT AT gold.close + 2 SIZING 1
```

!!! note "realized_pnl is currently strategy-level"
    `POSITION.<stream>.realized_pnl` returns the strategy's total realized P&L, not the per-symbol slice. True per-symbol realized requires lot-level accounting — tracked on the [backlog](../../planned.md#phase-28-exploratory).

## Conditional expressions (`CASE`)

<!-- qkt-doc: grammar -->
```qkt
CASE
  WHEN <cond1> THEN <expr1>
  WHEN <cond2> THEN <expr2>
  [ ELSE <default_expr> ]
END
```

```qkt
LET size = CASE
  WHEN atr(btc, 14) > 200 THEN 0.05        -- volatile: small size
  WHEN atr(btc, 14) > 100 THEN 0.10        -- normal
  ELSE 0.15                                -- quiet: bigger
END

RULES
    WHEN ema(btc.close, 9) CROSSES ABOVE ema(btc.close, 21)
    THEN BUY btc SIZING size
```

`CASE` is an **expression**, not a control-flow statement. It evaluates and returns a value; the surrounding context (here `LET size = ...`) decides what to do with it.

If no `WHEN` matches and there's no `ELSE`, the expression returns `null`.

## Math helpers

<!-- qkt-doc: grammar -->
```qkt
abs(<expr>)
max(<a>, <b>)
min(<a>, <b>)
sqrt(<expr>)
log(<expr>)
exp(<expr>)
floor(<expr>)
ceil(<expr>)
round(<expr>)
pow(<base>, <exp>)
```

```qkt
LET vol_norm = (btc.close - sma(btc.close, 20)) / atr(btc, 14)
LET signal_strength = abs(vol_norm)

WHEN signal_strength > 2 THEN LOG "strong dislocation" z=vol_norm
```

## Aggregates

An aggregate folds a series over a window. The function name is followed by one series in parentheses and a `SINCE` window:

<!-- qkt-doc: grammar -->
```qkt
sum(<expr>)  SINCE OPEN | T-<N>     -- total
mean(<expr>) SINCE OPEN | T-<N>     -- average
max(<expr>)  SINCE OPEN | T-<N>     -- largest value
min(<expr>)  SINCE OPEN | T-<N>     -- smallest value
```

- `SINCE T-N` covers the last `N` closed bars of the stream the series is evaluated on. It is `null` until `N` bars have been seen, so it composes with the usual null handling.
- `SINCE OPEN` covers the bars since the position on that stream was opened. It resets whenever the position opens, closes or flips.

A rolling window also has a two-argument shorthand. Each form is exactly the `SINCE T-N` aggregate beside it, and `N` must be a positive integer literal:

<!-- qkt-doc: grammar -->
```qkt
sum(<expr>, N)          -- sum(<expr>) SINCE T-N
mean(<expr>, N)         -- mean(<expr>) SINCE T-N
avg(<expr>, N)          -- mean(<expr>) SINCE T-N
count(<condition>, N)   -- sum(CASE WHEN <condition> THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) SINCE T-N
```

`max(a, b)` and `min(a, b)` keep meaning the larger and smaller of two values; for a rolling extreme use `max(<expr>) SINCE T-N` or the `highest` / `lowest` indicators (which exclude the current bar). A `SINCE T-N` window adds `N` bars to its stream's automatic warmup.

```qkt
STRATEGY rolling_count VERSION 1
SYMBOLS
    btc = BACKTEST:BTCUSDT EVERY 1d
LET pct_up_days = count(btc.close > btc.close[1], 20) / 20
RULES
    WHEN pct_up_days > 0.7 THEN LOG "70%+ of last 20 bars up"
```

## Null handling

Expressions return `null` when:

- An indicator isn't warm yet
- A lookback `[N]` is out of range
- A division has denominator 0
- A function gets unexpected input

`null` propagates through arithmetic: `null + 5 = null`. Comparisons with `null` always return `false`. This means **conditions short-circuit safely during warmup** — your rule simply doesn't fire while data is missing.

!!! info "Explicit `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` coming in Phase 24"
    Phase 24 will add the explicit checks. See [Planned features](../../planned.md#phase-24-risk-sizing-primitives). Today, the silent short-circuit handles every case where you'd want them — your rule simply doesn't fire while an indicator is null.

## Type rules (loose)

The DSL is dynamically typed at the expression level. Most operations coerce sensibly:

- Number + Number → Number
- Number + Null → Null
- Boolean AND/OR Boolean → Boolean
- Comparing Number to Number → Boolean
- Comparing Number to Null → False
- String concat is not supported in conditions; strings are only valid in `LOG` action arguments

Mixing types in arithmetic produces a compile error: `5 + "hello"` is a parse-time failure.

## Common gotchas

- **Division by zero returns `null`, not infinity or an error.** A divide-by-zero in a condition makes the condition `false`. Be aware.
- **Operator precedence.** `AND` binds tighter than `OR`. Parentheses are free.
- **`a == b` vs `a = b`** — both work. Pick one and stick with it for the project.
- **No string operations in conditions.** Strings are for `LOG` only. Don't try `WHEN btc.symbol = "BTCUSDT"` (the parser doesn't expose `symbol` on streams).
- **`null` is opinionated.** Treating null-comparisons as false simplifies most code but can hide bugs. Explicit `IS NULL`/`IS NOT NULL` lands in Phase 24.

## What this composes with

- [Conditions](conditions.md) — the most common host for expressions
- [Indicators](indicators.md) — produce numbers your expressions consume
- [SIZING](sizing.md) and [BRACKET](bracket.md) — arithmetic in action parameters
- [LET](let-defaults.md) — name a complex expression for reuse

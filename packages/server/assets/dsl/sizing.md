# SIZING

Every way to specify the size of a `BUY` or `SELL` order. Sizing is the single mandatory field on entry actions (unless `DEFAULTS.sizing` is set).

## The forms available today

| Form | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `SIZING <expression>` | Computed lots / units |
| `SIZING <expression> PCT OF EQUITY` | Percentage of total equity (cash + open P&L) |
| `SIZING <expression> PCT OF BALANCE` | Percentage of cash balance only |
| `SIZING <expression> USD` | Computed USD notional value |
| `SIZING <N> PCT RISK` | Sized so a stop-out loses N% of equity (sugar over `SIZING RISK N/100`) |
| `SIZING <N> PCT RISK OF BOOK` | Sized so a stop-out loses N% of the portfolio book balance |
| `SIZING RISK $ <expression>` | Computed account-currency risk with bracket stop geometry |
| `SIZING POSITION.<stream>` | The full current position quantity (for closes/scaling) |

## Fixed quantity

```qkt
BUY btc SIZING 0.1
```

Buys 0.1 of whatever the venue's unit is. For Bybit spot BTC, that's 0.1 BTC. For MT5 EURUSD, that's 0.1 lots = 10,000 units of base currency.

**When to use:** prototyping, simple strategies, when the venue's lot size aligns with your risk budget at known prices.

**Gotcha:** doesn't scale with account size. A `0.1 lots` size on a $1,000 account is risky; on $100,000 it's tiny. Use percent-based sizing for portable strategies.

## Percent of equity

```qkt
BUY btc SIZING 5.0 PCT OF EQUITY
```

Sizes the position at 5% of `ACCOUNT.equity`. If equity is $10,000, the order is sized to represent $500 of position value (at current price).

**Variants:**

```qkt
SIZING 5.0 PCT OF EQUITY    -- 5% of equity (includes open P&L)
SIZING 10 PCT OF BALANCE    -- 10% of cash balance only (ignores open P&L)
```

The difference matters when you have unrealized P&L: `EQUITY` includes it (the size scales with open profit/loss), `BALANCE` doesn't.

**Convention:** the number before `%`/`PCT` is always a percentage, in every sizing form. `SIZING 5.0 PCT OF EQUITY` and `SIZING 5.0 % OF EQUITY` both mean 5% (fraction 0.05), the same way `SIZING 0.5 PCT RISK` means 0.5% (fraction 0.005).

**When to use:** position sizing that scales with account performance. Good for compounding strategies.

## Fixed USD notional

```qkt
BUY btc SIZING 1000 USD
```

Sizes the position to represent exactly $1000 of notional value (at current price). For BTC at $50k, that's 0.02 BTC. For BTC at $60k, that's 0.01666… BTC.

**When to use:** consistent dollar exposure across symbols of different price levels. "I want $1000 of BTC and $1000 of EUR regardless of how each is priced."

## Position-based (for partial closes)

```qkt
SELL btc SIZING POSITION.btc
```

Sells exactly the current position size — equivalent to `CLOSE btc`. Mostly used in scale-out logic:

```qkt
SELL btc SIZING 0.5 * POSITION.btc     -- partial close: 50% of position
```

You can multiply, divide, or do any arithmetic on `POSITION.<stream>`.

## Risk-percent sizing

```qkt
BUY btc SIZING 0.5 PCT RISK
    BRACKET { STOP LOSS AT btc.close - atr(btc, 14) * 2, TAKE PROFIT RR 3 }
```

Sizes the position so that, if the stop hits, the loss is exactly N% of equity. `SIZING 0.5 PCT RISK` is sugar for `SIZING RISK 0.005` — both compile to the same engine path. Use the PCT form to avoid decimal-shift bugs when expressing small risk fractions: `0.5 PCT RISK` is unambiguous; `RISK 0.005` invites typos. The engine resolves `AT`, expression-based `BY`, and `PCT` stop prices with the current entry geometry before it computes the order quantity.

Requires a `BRACKET` with a `STOP_LOSS` — without one the compiler rejects the strategy because no stop distance can be established safely.

**When to use:** the default for portable strategies. Risk-percent sizing scales correctly with account size, stop distance, and instrument volatility.

### Portfolio book risk

```qkt
BUY btc SIZING 0.5 PCT RISK OF BOOK
    BRACKET { STOP LOSS BY 500, TAKE PROFIT BY 1000 }
```

`OF BOOK` is available to portfolio children and uses `CAPITAL + realized PnL` across
all children. It deliberately excludes unrealized PnL, so an open-book drawdown does
not reduce subsequent sizes. Treat that balance-style basis as a leverage risk; use
book exposure and drawdown limits to cap new exposure. A standalone strategy, or a
portfolio child without a bound book balance, fails closed instead of falling back to
strategy equity.

## Computing risk-based size manually

The same effect is also achievable with `USD` sizing and a `LET` expression — useful when you want the size to factor in something `PCT RISK` doesn't model (e.g. correlation across positions):

```qkt
LET stopDist = atr(btc, 14) * 2
LET riskUsd  = ACCOUNT.equity * 0.01           # 1% of equity at risk
LET riskQty  = riskUsd / stopDist              # size that loses riskUsd if stop hits

RULES
    WHEN ema(btc.close, 9) CROSSES ABOVE ema(btc.close, 21)
    THEN BUY btc SIZING riskQty
         BRACKET { STOP LOSS AT btc.close - stopDist, TAKE PROFIT AT btc.close + stopDist * 3 }
```

This is equivalent to `SIZING 1.0 PCT RISK` with the same bracket — you compute the size from `equity_at_risk / stop_distance` yourself. Reach for the manual form only when you need a sizing expression `PCT RISK` doesn't express.

## Streak-Adjusted Risk

Risk sizing accepts any numeric expression, including the trade-streak ledger:

```qkt
RULES
    WHEN ema(btc.close, 9) CROSSES ABOVE ema(btc.close, 21)
     AND STREAK.losses < 2
    THEN BUY btc SIZING RISK $ (100 + 0.30 * STREAK.banked)
         BRACKET { STOP LOSS BY 40, TAKE PROFIT BY 90 }
```

This is anti-martingale sizing: base risk remains `$100`, and only current win-streak profit is pressed. `STREAK.banked` resets to `0` after a losing close.

## Computed set-once sizing

Every numeric sizing form above carries an expression, not just a numeric literal. That means inverse-volatility and discrete conviction tiers can be composed directly with a structural bracket. Risk sizing converts the computed account-currency budget through the resolved stop distance, contract size, and quote-to-account rate at the normal sizing boundary:

```qkt
LET conviction = CASE
  WHEN sweepConfirm AND vrConfirm AND silverConfirm THEN 2
  WHEN sweepConfirm AND vrConfirm THEN 1.5
  ELSE 1
END
LET riskBudget = 100 * conviction

RULES
  WHEN shock AND POSITION.gold = 0
  THEN SELL gold SIZING RISK $ riskBudget BRACKET {
    STOP LOSS AT gold.high + 1.2 * atr(gold.candle, 14),
    TAKE PROFIT AT sma(gold.close, 20)
  }
```

The sizing expression is evaluated once when the action constructs the order request. The resulting request carries a fixed quantity through submission and fill; it is not reevaluated on later bars. Use `RESIZE` only when continuous target rebalancing is intentional.

Quantity cannot be selected after the order's own fill because the venue requires quantity at submission. "Set once at entry" therefore means evaluation from the latest deterministic strategy state when QKT creates the entry order. Bracket stop geometry is available to `PCT RISK`, `SIZING RISK <fraction>`, and `SIZING RISK $ <expression>` during that evaluation.

## Defaults via DEFAULTS

If most of your strategies use the same sizing, hoist it:

```qkt
DEFAULTS {
  SIZING = 0.1
}

RULES
    WHEN ema(btc.close, 9) CROSSES ABOVE ema(btc.close, 21)
    THEN BUY btc     -- inherits SIZING = 0.1
```

## Multiple sizings per stack

A `STACK` (pyramid) carries one `SIZING` for the seed layer, but you can override per layer in the layer-list form:

```qkt
BUY btc STACK [
  0.05,                       -- seed: 0.05 lots
  0.10 AT entry + 200,        -- layer 2: 0.10 lots at +200
  0.15 AT entry + 400         -- layer 3: 0.15 lots at +400
]
BRACKET { STOP LOSS BY 300, TAKE PROFIT BY 1000 }
```

See [STACK](stack.md).

## Common gotchas

- **Sizing is required.** Either on the action or via `DEFAULTS.sizing`. Both missing = parse error.
- **Percent-of-equity ignores stop distance.** A 5% position with a tight stop loses very little; with a wide stop loses a lot. Use the manual workaround above to factor in the stop.
- **Broker volume bounds.** MT5 brokers enforce minimum/maximum lots (`volumeMin`, `volumeMax`) and a step (`volumeStep`). A computed size outside the bounds rejects after downward step quantization.
- **Whole-number lots on some venues.** Futures often require integer contracts. A computed size of `0.327` will round (typically down) or reject. Check your venue's specs.
- **Sizing units are venue-side.** A "size of 0.1" means 0.1 of the venue's unit (lots, contracts, base currency) — not 0.1 USD or 0.1% of anything.
- **Computed entry sizing is set once.** It does not track the expression after QKT emits the order. Use `RESIZE` for deliberate per-bar rebalancing.

## What this composes with

- [Actions](actions.md) — `SIZING` is a modifier on `BUY` / `SELL`
- [BRACKET](bracket.md) — pair sizing with `STOP_LOSS`/`TAKE_PROFIT`
- [LET](let-defaults.md) — name a sizing computation for reuse
- [DEFAULTS](let-defaults.md) — set a default sizing for the whole strategy
- [Planned features](../../planned.md) — `PCT RISK` and what's coming
